## Welcome to my TCP/IP Networking Project

In this project, I built basic TCP Server and TCP Client.  I based these applications based on some examples in an old Computer Communication Networking textbook.  These applications are written in C and compiled using gcc on a moden Linux system.  The applications each run in different terminals on the same computer.  After I built this project, I ran it a few times, tested it, and tried to break it.  I developed a list of questions to follow-up on, and learn more about the the functionality of these C libraries and this code.   

### System Prerequisities
These systems were built on an Ubuntu 18.04 system, and were compiled with gcc version 7.5.0.  

### Compiling the code

Add instructions here

### Running the code
In terminal #1, run the TCP Server with the following:
```markdown
$ ./TCPServerExample 3000
```
In a second terminal, run a TCP Client with the following:
```
$ ./TCPClientExample 127.0.0.1
```
You will get some feedback indicating that the Client has connected to the TCP Server:
```
$ ./TCPClientExample 127.0.0.1
Connected: server address is 127.0.0.1
Transmit:

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/PaulSkelly/glowing-winner/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
